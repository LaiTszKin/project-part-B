# Change: Optimize Frontend Layout

## Why
The current interface, while functional, lacks the polished spacing and consistent visual hierarchy of a true Apple-style application. Users expect a more refined, minimalist aesthetic with better whitespace management and clearer visual separation between elements.

## What Changes
- Refine window padding and margins for a more "breathing" layout
- Standardize component spacing (input fields, buttons, list)
- Enhance the visual hierarchy of typography (headings vs body)
- Optimize the task list presentation for better readability
- Ensure consistent application of the Apple-inspired color palette

## Impact
- Affected specs: `ui-layout` (New capability)
- Affected code: `main.py` (GUI class)
